        Environmental science offers various courses in
India after completing 10th and 12th grades.
These include certificate courses, diploma
courses, undergraduate (UG) courses,
postgraduate (PG) courses, and PhD courses.
The courses cover topics such as environmental
issues, pollution, natural resources, energy
systems, and sustainable development. Students
can pursue these courses in various disciplines
and across different institutions, including
online platforms like Udemy, Coursera, IGNOU,
and Alison. The average salary after completing
an undergraduate or postgraduate degree in
environmental science is around INR 5,00,000
annually. Admission to these courses is based
on merit, entrance exams, and educational
qualifications. Additionally, there are online
certificate courses available, which are less
expensive and have a shorter duration
compared to degree courses. These courses
cover topics such as environmental
management, ecology, and sustainability. After
completing these courses, job opportunities
include roles such as environmental engineers,
environmental biologists, and environmental
scientists.<br>
